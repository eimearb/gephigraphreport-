> #Gephi Network Graph
-------------
>
>
> <p> Gephi is an interactive tool which allows us to visualize and analyze network graphs in
> an interesting, accurate and visually appealing way. This tool has provided me with an
> in dept understanding of the connections between <b> nodes (i.e. A Facebook friend - the
> connection has to be accepted by both parties)</b> among my friends on Facebook within
> my social groups and the type of connection that these nodes have i.e.<b>  bonding – a
> strong tie with many connections, bridging – a weak tie with connections in diverse
> groups and clusters – a tight subgroup of nodes where bonding is occurring.</b> It has
> also shown me how strong these connections are and which nodes have the most. In
> this report I wish to discuss the methods I used to create the graph, my findings and
> finally my understandings and observations. </p> 
> 
>
> <p> We were introduced to Gephi in our lab in week 2, where we downloaded the tool and
> learnt about the basic in’s and out’s. We used Netvizz to show the links between our
> friends on Facebook by importing the data onto Gephi. At first the data shown was too
> much to process as I had almost 500 nodes, some of which didn’t have any connections
> to others. So, I decided to filter the data, by going into filters on the right hand side then
> topology and degree range then filtered the data the data down to around 50 nodes. The
> connections that I chose to display were the connections between my friends from
> college (red), friends from work (green), friends from my athletics club (blue) and my
> family. After I had my nodes at a more manageable scale I started to play around with
> the layout and colour schemes. I began with the layout; the layout which I chose was
> force atlas 2 which spread out the nodes and made the information easier to
> understand. When I was finally happy with my layout I went to the statistics tab on the
> right hand side and ran the modularity, this provided me with the information on the
> size distribution of the nodes on my graph. I then went to the partition tab on the left
> side and chose modularity class, which colour coded all of the nodes depending on their
> ties. The colours showed that the red nodes were my friends from college, the green
> nodes were my friends from work, the blue nodes were friends from my athletic club
> and finally, the purple nodes were my family. I then went on to find out which nodes
> were the bonding nodes and which were the bridging nodes i.e. which clusters had the
> strongest and weakest ties, so, again in statistics I ran the average degree, then went to
> partition and ran that. This provided me with some interesting information about the
> connections within my social group. The larger clusters had more bonding ties and
> nearly all groups contained some bridging ties with showed how well connected my
> social group were. </p>

> <p> When you look at my graph you instantly see that the cluster of blue nodes and <b> Edges
> (Describes the connection between the 2 nodes. It can be Unimodal or multimodal.
> Unimodal - for example twitter as it is user to user and you can only see the things
> from people that you follow. Multimodal - for example Facebook as you can see
> information that friends of friends post, like information that groups and pages
> share etc.) </b> which is my friends from athletics have the least amount of ties to the other
> clusters, which makes sense as most of my friends from athletics don’t know any of my
> friends from work, college or many of my family members. But on the other hand when
> you look at the red, green and purple nodes you can see a lot of bonding, bridging,
> <b> betweeness centrality (i.e. a friend of a friend you’re connected to but don’t have an
> immediate connection to) </b> ties amongst one another as the majority of my friends and
> family know one another or have a friend who knows them. Finally when you look at
> the graph you can pick out the <b> eigenvector centrality (i.e. the member with the most
> bonding ties within my graph)</b>, which is completely accurate as it is my best friend
> Ellen who knows the most part of my family and friends. </p>
